\usage{
commonSeqsBar(
  productive.aa,
  samples,
  color.sample = NULL,
  color.intersection = NULL,
  color = "#377eb8",
  labels = "no"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{productive.aa}{A list data frames of of productive amino acid sequences 
generated by LymphoSeq function productiveSeq where the aggregate parameter 
was set to "aminoAcid".}

\item{samples}{The names of two or more samples in the productive.aa 
list whose intersections will shown.}

\item{color.sample}{The name of a single sample in the productive.aa list whose 
sequences will be colored in all samples that they appear in.}

\item{color.intersection}{The names of two or more samples in the productive.aa 
list whose intersections will be colored.}

\item{color}{A character vector of a color name that will be used highlight a selected 
sample or multiple sample intersections.}

\item{labels}{A character vector indicating whether the number of 
intersecting sequences should be shown on the tops of the bars.  Options 
include "yes" or "no".}
}
\value{
Returns an UpSetR bar plot showing the number of intersecting sequences 
across multiple samples.
}
\description{
Creates an UpSetR bar plot showing the number of intersecting sequences across 
multiple samples.  This function is useful when more than 3 samples are being 
compared.
