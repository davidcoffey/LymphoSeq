#' @param list A list of data frames consisting of antigen receptor sequences 
#' imported by the LymphoSeq function readImmunoSeq.
#' @param sample A character vector indicating the name of the sample in the productive
#' sequence list. 
#' @param sequence A character vector of one ore more amino acid or nucleotide 
#' CDR3 sequences to search.
#' @param editDistance An integer giving the minimum edit distance that the 
#' sequence must be less than or equal to.  See details below.
#' @param type A character vector indicating whether "aminoAcid" or "nucleotide" sequences
#' should be aligned.  If "aminoAcid" is specified, then run productiveSeqs first.
#' @param method A character vector indicating the multiple sequence alignment method to 
#' be used.  Refer to the Bioconductor msa package for more details.  Options incude 
#' "ClustalW", "ClustalOmega", and "Muscle".
#' @param output A character vector indicating where the multiple sequence alignemnt should be

#' Bioconductor package msa installation instructions for more details.
#' @details Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two sequences 
#' are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to 
#' transform one sequence into the other.  For example, an edit distance of 0 
#' means the sequences are identical and an edit distance of 1 indicates that 
#' the sequences different by a single amino acid or nucleotide.
