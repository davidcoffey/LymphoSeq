#' Clonal relatedness
#' 
#' Calculates the clonal relatedness for each sample in a list of data frames.
#' 
#' @param list A list data frames of unproductive or productive nucleotide 
#' sequences or productive nucleotide sequences.  Nucleotide and count are 
#' required columns.
#' @param editDistance An integer giving the minimum edit distance that the 
#' sequence must be less than or equal to. See details below.
#' @details  Clonal relatedness is the proportion of nucleotide sequences that
#' are related by a defined edit distance threshold.  The value ranges from 0 to
#' 1 where 0 indicates no sequences are related and 1 indicates all sequences 
#' are related.
#' 
#' Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two sequences 
#' are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to 
#' transform one sequence into the other. For example, an edit distance of 0 
#' means the sequences are identical and an edit distance of 1 indicates that 
#' the sequences different by a single amino acid or nucleotide.
#' @return Returns a data frame with the calculated clonal relatedness for each sample.
