#' Top frequencies
#' 
#' Creates a data frame of the top productive amino acid sequences that have a 
#' specified minimum frequency threshold and reports the number of samples that 
#' the sequence appears in along with the minimum, maximum, and mean frequency 
#' across all samples.  For T cell receptor beta sequences, the \% prevalence 
#' and antigen specificity of that sequence is also provided.
#' 
#' @param productive.aa A list data frames of of productive amino acid sequences 
#' imported using the function LymphoSeq function productiveSeq where the 
#' aggregate parameter was set to "aminoAcid".  
#' @param percent The minimum \% frequency that the sequence appears in any of 
#' the listed samples.
#' @return A data frame of amino acid sequences and the number of samples that 
#' the sequence appears in along with the minimum, maximum, and mean frequency 
#' across all samples.  
#' For T cell receptor beta sequences, additionally reported is the 
#' \% prevalence that the sequence appears in 55 healthy donor blood samples.  
#' Also provided is the antigen specificity of that sequence if known by 
#' comparing it to a database of previously reported sequences in the 
#' literature.  The prevalenceTRB and publishedTRB databases are located in a 
#' separate package called LymphoSeqDB that should be loaded automatically.
