Description: This R package analyzes high-throughput sequencing of T
        and B cell receptor complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3)
        sequences generated by Adaptive Biotechnologies' ImmunoSEQ
        assay.  Its input comes from tab-separated value (.tsv) files
        exported from the ImmunoSEQ analyzer.
